"Welcome to the world of Oochamon! I am a disembodied voice, I don't have a name, but you can call me the Tutorial Master!"
"To start, let's teach you how to move. Type in **w, a, s, or d** to move, and move up to the door!"

(move up, trigger next event)

"Let's also show you how to use *advanced movement tech!* (oooh, ahhh)"
"You can **jump** ahead tiles by putting a number after a movement key, or by typing a letter multiple times."
"For example, you can do `w2` to jump 2 spaces forward, or `ddd` to jump 3 spaces to the right. Give it a try!"

(move up, trigger next event)

"You can also chain these movement commands together, to do some crazy movement!"
"For example, you can do `w2d2` to move up 2 then right 2, or `aaaww` to move left 3 then up 2. Give it a try!"

(move up, trigger next event)

"Great work!"
"Now, check out your menu with `/menu`. You have an Oochamon you picked out, right?"
"Go check it out, and play around in the menu to learn about it a little bit. There's even a settings menu!"
"Head over to the next door upwards as soon as you are ready to move on."

(move up, trigger next event)

"Let's get you a few items to start with. Here's a few Potions and a Prism. [grant 3 potions and 1 perfect prism]"
"Prisms are our way of capturing and taming the wild Oochamon of the world. It's very painless for them, I assure you."
"Let's try out catching an Oochamon now. I've created a simulated Oochamon for you to learn catching with!"
"You won't be able to keep this Oochamon after the tutorial, this is just to teach you how to capture things.\nYou will have ample opportunity to catch more on the planet."
"Move on to the next door after you capture the Oochamon!"

(catch Oochamon, give flag upon caught Oochamon, move on to door to trigger next event) 

"Great work! If you look at that new Oochamon in your menu, you'll notice it has special stats, called **Bonuses**."
"Bonuses are a special power an Oochamon has, unique to itself, that increase its various stats based on random chance."
"We are researching a way to increase these to have an Oochamon reach it's ultimate power, but you may have to speak with the Researchers on that."
"Oochamon also have special abilities! You can view what your Oochamon ability does using `/lookup ability`."
"On that note, `/lookup` has a few other things to view as well, so keep the command in mind!"
"Move on to the next door."

(Move onto the next door)

"Let's learn about the bread and butter of Oochamon. Trainer fights!"
"I've created a simulated trainer for you to fight. It's not a real person, but it still has feelings."
"Anyways, go beat him up! This will be a good way for you to learn how to fight."

[SimTrainer: "Initiating battle sequence."]
(Fight SimTrainer)
[SimTrainer: "Ouch. Granting Access to Door."]
[SimTrainer: "Please proceed."]

(Move onto the next door)

"Great work. I knew you could do it! I'll give SimTrainer a cyber cookie later to make him feel better."
"That's basically how the game works. Catch Oochamon, beat up peoples teams of Oochamon, and save the world!"
"Or something. I'm not your Parent. See ya, and enjoy the grand world of Oochamon!"
