GIMMICK (CORRUPTED FORMS):
	- Oochamon imbued with a special power from the planet gain the ability to twist into a corrupted version of themselves.
	- In gameplay terms, this gives every(?) final stage evolution oochamon the ability to swap between a "pure" and "corrupted" form of the oochamon.
		- There are 2 types of Corrupted Forms:
			- Crystal: Gives the Oochamon a second typing as well as major stat changes and an ability change, that can change how the oochamon is played
			- Void: Gives the Oochamon a second Void typing with slightly lowered stat changes and access to Void moves, that makes them offensively very strong.
		- Each of these Corrupted Forms has a downside to having too many of them:
			- Crystal Oochamon have a base chance to disobey your orders, that increases the more of them you have in your party.
			- Void Oochamon have a bit lowered stats, and their stats decrease a little bit more the more of them you have in your party.
			- Both Crystal and Void Corrupted Oochamon do add to each others "void total", but less.
		
	- [Abyssal Droplet] [Prismatic Key] [Extractor]
	- Corrupted Oochamon will be unlocked after a certain story event.
	- You must use a specific item to unlock an Oochamon's corrupted form, except for your starter, who will have it's corrupted form from the start. 
	- You will never encounter corrupted forms in the main story, besides the thief side story and anything relating to Oochabot.
	- Every Oochamon starts in it's pure form when caught, except for Oochabot, who by default is in his corrupted form.

			- [Oochabot] Incredibly incoherent, lots of screaming in Voltaic
