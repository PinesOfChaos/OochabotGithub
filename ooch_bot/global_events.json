You can use a number after the direction, or something like \"www\" or \"ssss\" to jump up to 6 tiles in one direction.\nIf you want to chain together these, you can do something like this: `w4,d4` to do 2 movement actions at once.\nYou can type `/menu` as well to pull up the in game menu!\nYou can use `/teleport` to teleport between the hub and your current checkpoint, to help you access the shop easier!\nLastly, you can use `/lookup` to get a description of what a move or ability does, or use it to view the type matchup table or the controls at any time!\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask Pines or Jeff!",
